<h1>Brief for w/c 27 August 2019</h1>
Hi all, it's project week this week so I'm going to set you off on yours. Remember to continue practicing on edabit too which you'll need to work around your project work.
Your projects are websites/web apps that you'll need to use HTML, CSS and JS to solve. Make them look as nice as possible.
You can ask each other questions but these are definitely individual projects not team projects.
DEADLINE 2pm FRIDAY 30TH AUGUST
<h2>1. A count down timer.</h2>
The user should be able to:
- Set the amount of time they want the timer to run for.
- visually see the time going down.
